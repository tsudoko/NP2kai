Barebones 9P server for easier VM memory access from the host.

Uses code from these public domain projects:

Structure rundown
-----------------

c9.{c,h} implements the low-level 9P protocol primitives. It's copied verbatim
from the ~ft/c9 repo, feel free to replace with newer versions if needed.

c9hl.{c,h} is the high-level API, it's currently heavily based on code from
~ft/9pro/9pex.c. Symbols prefixed with `extern` in the c9hl.h file must be
implemented by the library user.

np2_9p.c contains a thin layer of glue code between np2 and 9P. Several functions
(c9hl_init, c9hl_step, c9hl_deinit) still need to be called in platform-specific
main loop and init/deinit routines as of now.
